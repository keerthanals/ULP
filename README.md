### Project Description
Ever wondered who roasts better ‚Äì Mom or Dad? Our app lets you experience both sides of a typical desi household roast, but in Malayalam! Record your situation, then switch between Mom and Dad mode to hear some epic, sarcastic, and over-the-top responses ‚Äì complete with hilarious voice filters.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We live in a world where parents roast you mercilessly ‚Äì but there's no official scoreboard. WHO ROASTS BETTER?
This has gone unanswered for generations.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An interactive roast simulator that lets you switch between Mom and Dad characters who respond in their signature Malayalam tones ‚Äì full of sass, sarcasm, and cultural spice üå∂
We‚Äôve added voice modulation, hilarious pre-recorded lines, and situational triggers for MAXIMUM roast energy.
